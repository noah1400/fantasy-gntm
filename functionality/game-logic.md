Off-Plattform the order of draft pick of the players are determined randomly

Its a snake draft. The first player picks a model, then the next player in order picks a model, the last player in the order can pick two models, then it goes in the reverse order until the first player has picked their second model.

the points of each model of one episodes gets added to the players points if the model was selected by this player during the episode.

If after an episode a model gets eliminated and a player has picked this model, they are allowed to pick another model out of all models that are not picked by other players (this happens first come first serve). The points the eliminated model stay on the players "point-account".

If after an episode a model gets eliminated that was picked by a player and there are no models that are not picked by other players ( free agents ) all players need to select a model that get removed from their picked models. After that the game continues with each player having one model in their deck.

After each player removes one model, all players can decide if they want to swap a model with a not picked model beginning with the player with the least points and ending with the player with the highest points.

If the game is with one player in their deck and a model gets eliminated the playes still are allowed to pick a free model. If no model is left the player is out of the game and their current points are their final points. All other players play until the season is over.

All actions that change the game state (e.g. eliminations) only come into effect after the episode ends.
