Admin features.

The admin is also a player.
Admin has access to admin panel.
Admin can add players and models.
Admin can create seasons, episodes and actions.
Admin can eliminate models.
Admin can set the order of the draft and start the game.
Even though a episode has an end date the admin can end an episode, this causes all actions that change the gamestate (e.g. eliminations) to come into effect.

Admin can log actions, by first selecting a model and then selecting a actions (this needs to happen fast, so big buttons and redirect to model select page to instantly log the next action)
